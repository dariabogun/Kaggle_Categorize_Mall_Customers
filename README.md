# Categorize Mall Customers using Segmentation 
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways. It allows for the effective allocation of marketing resources and the maximization of cross and up-selling opportunities. 
We have a Shopping Mall Dataset of Customers (Data has been picked from Kaggle) and our task is to categorize the customers into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways. 

## Setup:
  1) You will need to have `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
  2) The data set is from Kaggle and can be downloaded from this repo.

### That is all, I hope you enjoy!
